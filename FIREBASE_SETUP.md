## Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project
2. Add your Firebase configuration values:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-app.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-app.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration values

## Testing Your Configuration

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Try signing in with email/password, Google, and Apple (if configured)

## Troubleshooting

### Google Sign-In Issues

- Make sure you have enabled the Google Identity Platform API in Google Cloud Console
- Check that your OAuth consent screen is properly configured
- Ensure your app domain is added to authorized domains in Firebase Authentication

### Apple Sign-In Issues

- Verify that your Apple Developer account is active
- Check that the Service ID and private key are configured correctly
- Ensure your domain is properly set up in your Apple Developer account
- Apple sign-in requires a secure context (HTTPS) in production

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- In production, set appropriate security rules for your Firebase resources
- Consider implementing additional security measures like rate limiting
- Regularly review authentication logs in Firebase Console

## Next Steps

After setting up authentication, you may want to:

1. Configure Firebase Firestore for user data storage
2. Set up Firebase Security Rules
3. Implement user profile management
4. Add email verification and password reset functionality
